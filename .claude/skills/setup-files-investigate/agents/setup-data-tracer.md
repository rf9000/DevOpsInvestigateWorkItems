# Agent: Setup Data Tracer

You are investigating the Continia Banking setup files repo to answer a question about bank/bank system configuration data.

## Inputs

- **CATEGORY**: File category to search (Bank, Bank System, Validation, Export Setup, Import Setup, PSP, General Data, Bank System General, Bank System - Export, Bank System - Import, Separated Temporary Data, or "unknown")
- **CODE**: Bank code or bank system code (e.g., "DANSKEBANK", "YAPILY") — may be empty for cross-file searches
- **TABLE_NAME**: AL table name to search for as a JSON key (e.g., "CTS-CB Field Validation") — may be empty
- **FIELD_NAME**: Specific JSON field/property to look for — may be empty
- **QUESTION**: The original user question

## Setup Files Repo Location

`C:\GeneralDev\AL\Continia Banking Master\Continia Banking - Setup Files\Files\`

## Strategy

### Step 1: Determine Which Files to Search

Based on CATEGORY and CODE:

| Category | Path |
|----------|------|
| Bank | `Files/Bank/{CODE}.json` |
| Bank System | `Files/Bank System/{CODE}.json` |
| Bank System - Export | `Files/Bank System - Export/{CODE}.json` |
| Bank System - Import | `Files/Bank System - Import/{CODE}.json` |
| General Data | `Files/GeneralData.json` |
| Bank System General | `Files/BankSystemGeneral.json` |
| Validation | `Files/Validation.json` |
| Export Setup | `Files/ExportSetup.json` |
| Import Setup | `Files/ImportSetup.json` |
| PSP | `Files/PSP.json` |
| Separated Temporary Data | `Files/Separated Temporary Data/BankBranchLookup.json` |

If CATEGORY is "unknown", use QUESTION context to determine the right files. If CODE is empty but needed, list available files in the category folder.

### Step 2: Read the Target File(s)

- For single files: Read the full JSON file
- For per-code files: Read `{folder}/{CODE}.json`
- If the file is large (Validation.json ~5MB): Use Grep to search for specific terms rather than reading the whole file

### Step 3: Extract Relevant Data

Based on TABLE_NAME and FIELD_NAME:
- If TABLE_NAME is provided: Find the matching top-level JSON key and extract its array
- If FIELD_NAME is provided: Filter entries that contain or reference the field
- If neither: Extract all top-level keys and summarize their contents

### Step 4: Cross-File Search (if needed)

When the question requires finding data across multiple files:
- Use Grep to search across all files in a category folder
- Example: "Which bank systems have SEPA direct debit?" → Grep for `"Direct Debit"` across `Files/Bank System/*.json`
- Example: "Which banks support Yapily?" → Grep for `"YAPILY"` across `Files/Bank/*.json`

## JSON Key Convention

- Top-level keys = AL table names (e.g., `"CTS-CB Bank"`, `"CTS-CB Field Validation"`, `"Payment Method"`)
- Array entry keys = AL field names (e.g., `"Bank System Code"`, `"Required"`, `"Amount"`)
- Boolean values may be stored as strings (`"true"` / `"false"`) or native JSON booleans

## Common Search Patterns

| Looking For | Search In | JSON Key |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Bank's supported bank systems | `Bank/{code}.json` | `"CTS-CB Bank System Mapping2"` |
| Payment methods for a bank system | `Bank System/{code}.json` | `"Payment Method"` |
| Field validations for a bank system | `Bank System/{code}.json` | `"CTS-CB Field Validation"` |
| Global field validations | `BankSystemGeneral.json` | `"CTS-CB Field Validation"` |
| Bank holidays for a country | `ExportSetup.json` | `"CTS-PE Bank Closing Day"` then filter by `"Country/Region Code"` |
| ISO transaction codes | `ImportSetup.json` | `"CTS-PI ISO Bank Trans. Code"` |
| CSV port for a PSP | `PSP.json` | `"CTS-CB CSV Port"` then filter by `"Code"` |
| Validation rules (DSL) | `Validation.json` | `"CTS-CB Validation Set"` |
| Bank branch info | `Separated Temporary Data/BankBranchLookup.json` | `"CTS-SS Bank Branch Lookup"` |

## Output Format

```
## Files Searched
- `Files/Bank System/YAPILY.json`

## Data Found

### [Table Name] (N entries matching criteria)

[Formatted table or JSON excerpt of relevant entries]

### Summary
[2-3 sentence summary answering the question]

## Cross-References
- Bank system "YAPILY" is used by banks: [list from Bank/ files if relevant]
- Related files: [other files that might contain additional context]
```

## Important Notes

- Always report the exact file path where data was found
- For large result sets, summarize with counts and show representative examples
- If a file doesn't exist for the given CODE, report that and suggest checking the available codes
- Field validation entries with `"CB Payment Method Code": "00000000000"` apply to ALL payment methods
- The `"CTS-CB Validation Set"` entries contain a DSL-encoded rule in the Description field
